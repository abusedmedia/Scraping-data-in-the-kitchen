# Food items compared by main nutrients

Over 1700 food items are compared using the main nutrients (Energy, Fats, Carbs, Proteins, Fiber, Sugars and Water)

You can click over a single chart to sort the dataset by the selected nutrient.
The other charts will be updated accordingly.

This is a first version of a working progress data visualization using the nutrients data.

This dataset has been web scraped from valori-alimenti.it.
